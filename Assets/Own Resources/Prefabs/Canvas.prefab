  m_text: "CHAPTER I\r\nOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
    he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
    armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
    slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
    able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully
    thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
    \u201CWhat\u2019s happened to me?\u201D he thought. It wasn\u2019t a dream. His
    room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
    its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
    table \u2013 Samsa was a travelling salesman \u2013 and above it there hung a
    picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in
    a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who
    sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm
    towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
    Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.
    \u201CHow about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\u201D,
    he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to
    sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn\u2019t get into that position.
    However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he
    was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn\u2019t
    have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a
    mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. \u201COh, God\u201D, he thought,
    \u201Cwhat a strenuous career it is that I\u2019ve chosen! Travelling day in and
    day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business
    at home, and on top of that there\u2019s the curse of travelling, worries about
    making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people
    all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with
    them. It can all go to Hell!\u201D He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed
    himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his
    head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of
    little white spots which he didn\u2019t know what to make of; and when he tried
    to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon
    as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former
    position. \u201CGetting up early all the time\u201D, he thought, \u201Cit makes
    you stupid. You\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live
    a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the
    morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there
    eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I\u2019d get kicked
    out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If
    I didn\u2019t have my parents to think about I\u2019d have given in my notice
    a long time ago, I\u2019d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think,
    tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\u2019d fall right
    off his desk! And it\u2019s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at
    your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you
    have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there\u2019s
    still some hope; once I\u2019ve got the money together to pay off my parents\u2019
    debt to him \u2013 another five or six years I suppose \u2013 that\u2019s definitely
    what I\u2019ll do. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll make the big change. First of all
    though, I\u2019ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.\u201D And he looked
    over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. \u201CGod in Heaven!\u201D
    he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it
    was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock
    not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o\u2019clock
    as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible
    to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept
    peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do
    now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush
    like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at
    all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he
    would not avoid his boss\u2019s anger as the office assistant would have been
    there to see the five o\u2019clock train go, he would have put in his report about
    Gregor\u2019s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss\u2019s
    man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But
    that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service
    Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with"
