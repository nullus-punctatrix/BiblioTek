  m_text: "CHAPTER I\r\nOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams,
    he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
    armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
    slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
    able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully
    thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
    \u201CWhat\u2019s happened to me?\u201D he thought. It wasn\u2019t a dream. His
    room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
    its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the
    table \u2013 Samsa was a travelling salesman \u2013 and above it there hung a
    picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in
    a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who
    sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm
    towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
    Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.
    \u201CHow about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense\u201D,
    he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to
    sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn\u2019t get into that position.
    However hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he
    was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn\u2019t
    have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a
    mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. \u201COh, God\u201D, he thought,
    \u201Cwhat a strenuous career it is that I\u2019ve chosen! Travelling day in and
    day out. Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business
    at home, and on top of that there\u2019s the curse of travelling, worries about
    making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people
    all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with
    them. It can all go to Hell!\u201D He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed
    himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his
    head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of
    little white spots which he didn\u2019t know what to make of; and when he tried
    to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back because as soon
    as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former
    position. \u201CGetting up early all the time\u201D, he thought, \u201Cit makes
    you stupid. You\u2019ve got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live
    a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the
    morning to copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there
    eating their breakfasts. I ought to just try that with my boss; I\u2019d get kicked
    out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If
    I didn\u2019t have my parents to think about I\u2019d have given in my notice
    a long time ago, I\u2019d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think,
    tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He\u2019d fall right
    off his desk! And it\u2019s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at
    your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there, especially when you
    have to go right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, there\u2019s
    still some hope; once I\u2019ve got the money together to pay off my parents\u2019
    debt to him \u2013 another five or six years I suppose \u2013 that\u2019s definitely
    what I\u2019ll do. That\u2019s when I\u2019ll make the big change. First of all
    though, I\u2019ve got to get up, my train leaves at five.\u201D And he looked
    over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers. \u201CGod in Heaven!\u201D
    he thought. It was half past six and the hands were quietly moving forwards, it
    was even later than half past, more like quarter to seven. Had the alarm clock
    not rung? He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o\u2019clock
    as it should have been; it certainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible
    to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept
    peacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What should he do
    now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush
    like mad and the collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at
    all feel particularly fresh and lively. And even if he did catch the train he
    would not avoid his boss\u2019s anger as the office assistant would have been
    there to see the five o\u2019clock train go, he would have put in his report about
    Gregor\u2019s not being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss\u2019s
    man, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported sick? But
    that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of service
    Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would certainly come round with the
    doctor from the medical insurance company, accuse his parents of having a lazy
    son, and accept the doctor\u2019s recommendation not to make any claim as the
    doctor believed that no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what\u2019s
    more, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact, apart
    from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel completely well and
    even felt much hungrier than usual. He was still hurriedly thinking all this through,
    unable to decide to get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.
    There was a cautious knock at the door near his head. \u201CGregor\u201D, somebody
    called \u2013 it was his mother \u2013 \u201Cit\u2019s quarter to seven. Didn\u2019t
    you want to go somewhere?\u201D That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he
    heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had
    had before. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and uncontrollable
    squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out at first but then there
    was a sort of echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether
    he had heard properly or not. Gregor had wanted to give a full answer and explain
    everything, but in the circumstances contented himself with saying: \u201CYes,
    mother, yes, thank-you, I\u2019m getting up now.\u201D The change in Gregor\u2019s
    voice probably could not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother
    was satisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short conversation
    made the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against their expectations
    was still at home, and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors,
    gently, but with his fist. \u201CGregor, Gregor\u201D, he called, \u201Cwhat\u2019s
    wrong?\u201D And after a short while he called again with a warning deepness in
    his voice: \u201CGregor! Gregor!\u201D At the other side door his sister came
    plaintively: \u201CGregor? Aren\u2019t you well? Do you need anything?\u201D Gregor
    answered to both sides: \u201CI\u2019m ready, now\u201D, making an effort to remove
    all the strangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting long
    pauses between each, individual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but
    his sister whispered: \u201CGregor, open the door, I beg of you.\u201D Gregor,
    however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself
    for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at
    night even when he was at home. The first thing he wanted to do was to get up
    in peace without being disturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his
    breakfast. Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that
    he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in bed. He
    remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps caused by lying
    awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure imagination and he wondered
    how his imaginings would slowly resolve themselves today. He did not have the
    slightest doubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first sign
    of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen. It
    was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow himself up a
    little and they fell off by themselves. But it became difficult after that, especially
    as he was so exceptionally broad. He would have used his arms and his hands to
    push himself up; but instead of them he only had all those little legs continuously
    moving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If
    he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would stretch
    itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with that leg, all
    the others seemed to be set free and would move about painfully. \u201CThis is
    something that can\u2019t be done in bed\u201D, Gregor said to himself, \u201Cso
    don\u2019t keep trying to do it\u201D. The first thing he wanted to do was get
    the lower part of his body out of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part,
    and could not imagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;
    it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly shoved
    himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose the wrong direction,
    hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt
    that the lower part of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.
    So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first, carefully
    turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily, and despite its breadth
    and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly in the direction
    of the head. But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the
    fresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be a miracle
    if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself
    forward the same way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better
    to stay in bed than lose consciousness. It took just as much effort to get back
    to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more
    watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before,
    if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to
    this chaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to stay
    in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free of it in whatever
    way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time, though, he did not forget
    to remind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing to desperate
    conclusions. At times like this he would direct his eyes to the window and look
    out as clearly as he could, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow
    street was enveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer
    to offer him. \u201CSeven o\u2019clock, already\u201D, he said to himself when
    the clock struck again, \u201Cseven o\u2019clock, and there\u2019s still a fog
    like this.\u201D And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as
    if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back to their real
    and natural state. But then he said to himself: \u201CBefore it strikes quarter
    past seven I\u2019ll definitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then
    somebody will have come round from work to ask what\u2019s happened to me as well,
    as they open up at work before seven o\u2019clock.\u201D And so he set himself
    to the task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all at the
    same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and kept his head
    raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it. His back seemed to be
    quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet. His
    main concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which even through
    all the doors would probably raise concern if not alarm. But it was something
    that had to be risked. When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed
    \u2013 the new method was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was
    rock back and forth \u2013 it occurred to him how simple everything would be if
    somebody came to help him. Two strong people \u2013 he had his father and the
    maid in mind \u2013 would have been more than enough; they would only have to
    push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend down
    with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over onto the floor,
    where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use. Should he really call for
    help though, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked? Despite
    all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile at this thought. After
    a while he had already moved so far across that it would have been hard for him
    to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time was now ten past seven and
    he would have to make a final decision very soon. Then there was a ring at the
    door of the flat. \u201CThat\u2019ll be someone from work\u201D, he said to himself,
    and froze very still, although his little legs only became all the more lively
    as they danced around. For a moment everything remained quiet. \u201CThey\u2019re
    not opening the door\u201D, Gregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical
    hope. But then of course, the maid\u2019s firm steps went to the door as ever
    and opened it. Gregor only needed to hear the visitor\u2019s first words of greeting
    and he knew who it was \u2013 the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to
    be the only one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became
    highly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every one
    of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and devoted who would
    go so mad with pangs of conscience that he couldn\u2019t get out of bed if he
    didn\u2019t spend at least a couple of hours in the morning on company business?
    Was it really not enough to let one of the trainees make enquiries \u2013 assuming
    enquiries were even necessary \u2013 did the chief clerk have to come himself,
    and did they have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious
    that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate it?
    And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any proper decision,
    he swang himself with all his force out of the bed. There was a loud thump, but
    it wasn\u2019t really a loud noise. His fall was softened a little by the carpet,
    and Gregor\u2019s back was also more elastic than he had thought, which made the
    sound muffled and not too noticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough,
    though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it
    against the carpet. \u201CSomething\u2019s fallen down in there\u201D, said the
    chief clerk in the room on the left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something
    of the sort that had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk
    too; you had to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this
    question, the chief clerk\u2019s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots could
    now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right, Gregor\u2019s
    sister whispered to him to let him know: \u201CGregor, the chief clerk is here.\u201D
    \u201CYes, I know\u201D, said Gregor to himself; but without daring to raise his
    voice loud enough for his sister to hear him. \u201CGregor\u201D, said his father
    now from the room to his left, \u201Cthe chief clerk has come round and wants
    to know why you didn\u2019t leave on the early train. We don\u2019t know what
    to say to him. And anyway, he wants to speak to you personally. So please open
    up this door. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be good enough to forgive the untidiness
    of your room.\u201D Then the chief clerk called \u201CGood morning, Mr. Samsa\u201D.
    \u201CHe isn\u2019t well\u201D, said his mother to the chief clerk, while his
    father continued to speak through the door. \u201CHe isn\u2019t well, please believe
    me. Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever thinks about
    the business. It nearly makes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings;
    he\u2019s been in town for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with
    us in the kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His idea
    of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He\u2019s made a little frame, for
    instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you\u2019ll be amazed how nice
    it is; it\u2019s hanging up in his room; you\u2019ll see it as soon as Gregor
    opens the door. Anyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here; we wouldn\u2019t have
    been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he\u2019s so stubborn;
    and I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t well, he said this morning that he is, but he
    isn\u2019t.\u201D \u201CI\u2019ll be there in a moment\u201D, said Gregor slowly
    and thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word of the
    conversation. \u201CWell I can\u2019t think of any other way of explaining it,
    Mrs. Samsa\u201D, said the chief clerk, \u201CI hope it\u2019s nothing serious.
    But on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever become slightly
    unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome
    it because of business considerations.\u201D \u201CCan the chief clerk come in
    to see you now then?\u201D, asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door
    again. \u201CNo\u201D, said Gregor. In the room on his right there followed a
    painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry. So why did his
    sister not go and join the others? She had probably only just got up and had not
    even begun to get dressed. And why was she crying? Was it because he had not got
    up, and had not let the chief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his
    job and if that happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the
    same demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that yet.
    Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of abandoning his family.
    For the time being he just lay there on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition
    he was in would seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was
    only a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later
    on, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot. And it
    seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing
    him with talking at him and crying. But the others didn\u2019t know what was happening,
    they were worried, that would excuse their behaviour. The chief clerk now raised
    his voice, \u201CMr. Samsa\u201D, he called to him, \u201Cwhat is wrong? You barricade
    yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer, you are causing
    serious and unnecessary concern to your parents and you fail \u2013 and I mention
    this just by the way \u2013 you fail to carry out your business duties in a way
    that is quite unheard of. I\u2019m speaking here on behalf of your parents and
    of your employer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I
    am astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and sensible person,
    and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims. This morning,
    your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to appear, it\u2019s
    true \u2013 it had to do with the money that was recently entrusted to you \u2013
    but I came near to giving him my word of honour that that could not be the right
    explanation. But now that I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer
    feel any wish whatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position
    all that secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in private,
    but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don\u2019t see
    why your parents should not also learn of it. Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory
    of late; I grant you that it\u2019s not the time of year to do especially good
    business, we recognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no business
    at all, Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.\u201D \u201CBut Sir\u201D, called
    Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement, \u201CI\u2019ll
    open up immediately, just a moment. I\u2019m slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness,
    I haven\u2019t been able to get up. I\u2019m still in bed now. I\u2019m quite
    fresh again now, though. I\u2019m just getting out of bed. Just a moment. Be patient!
    It\u2019s not quite as easy as I\u2019d thought. I\u2019m quite alright now, though.
    It\u2019s shocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright
    last night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom
    of it last night already. They must have noticed it. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t
    let you know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness without
    staying at home. Please, don\u2019t make my parents suffer! There\u2019s no basis
    for any of the accusations you\u2019re making; nobody\u2019s ever said a word
    to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven\u2019t read the latest contracts
    I sent in. I\u2019ll set off with the eight o\u2019clock train, as well, these
    few hours of rest have given me strength. You don\u2019t need to wait, sir; I\u2019ll
    be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to tell that to the
    boss and recommend me to him!\u201D And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly
    knowing what he was saying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers \u2013
    this was easily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed
    \u2013 where he now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the
    door, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief clerk; the
    others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn what they would say
    when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked then it would no longer be
    Gregor\u2019s responsibility and he could rest. If, however, they took everything
    calmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried he really
    could be at the station for eight o\u2019clock. The first few times he tried to
    climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally
    gave himself one last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body
    was in serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let himself
    fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of it with
    his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could
    listen to what the chief clerk was saying. \u201CDid you understand a word of
    all that?\u201D the chief clerk asked his parents, \u201Csurely he\u2019s not
    trying to make fools of us\u201D. \u201COh, God!\u201D called his mother, who
    was already in tears, \u201Che could be seriously ill and we\u2019re making him
    suffer. Grete! Grete!\u201D she then cried. \u201CMother?\u201D his sister called
    from the other side. They communicated across Gregor\u2019s room. \u201CYou\u2019ll
    have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor is ill. Quick, get the doctor.
    Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now?\u201D \u201CThat was the voice of
    an animal\u201D, said the chief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with
    his mother\u2019s screams. \u201CAnna! Anna!\u201D his father called into the
    kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping his hands, \u201Cget a locksmith here,
    now!\u201D And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through
    the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his
    sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging
    shut again; they must have left it open; people often do in homes where something
    awful has happened. Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn\u2019t
    understand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer
    than before \u2013 perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised,
    though, that there was something wrong with him, and were ready to help. The first
    response to his situation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel
    better. He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and from the doctor
    and the locksmith he expected great and surprising achievements \u2013 although
    he did not really distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would
    be crucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a
    little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound
    different from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure he could
    judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had become very quiet in the next room.
    Perhaps his parents were sat at the table whispering with the chief clerk, or
    perhaps they were all pressed against the door and listening. Gregor slowly pushed
    his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw
    himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on
    the tips of his legs. He rested there a little while to recover from the effort
    involved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with
    his mouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth \u2013 how was he,
    then, to grasp the key? \u2013 but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up for
    with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning,
    ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown
    fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor. \u201CListen\u201D,
    said the chief clerk in the next room, \u201Che\u2019s turning the key.\u201D
    Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should have been calling to
    him, his father and his mother too: \u201CWell done, Gregor\u201D, they should
    have cried, \u201Ckeep at it, keep hold of the lock!\u201D And with the idea that
    they were all excitedly following his efforts, he bit on the key with all his
    strength, paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned
    round he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright with his
    mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the whole weight of
    his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it snapped back was Gregor\u2019s
    sign that he could break his concentration, and as he regained his breath he said
    to himself: \u201CSo, I didn\u2019t need the locksmith after all\u201D. Then he
    lay his head on the handle of the door to open it completely. Because he had to
    open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen. He
    had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors, and he had to
    do it very carefully if he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering
    the room. He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention
    to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud \u201COh!\u201D,
    which sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him \u2013 he was
    the nearest to the door \u2013 his hand pressed against his open mouth and slowly
    retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force. Gregor\u2019s mother,
    her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk\u2019s being there,
    looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward towards
    Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that spread themselves out
    around her as her head disappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile,
    and clenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room. Then
    he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and
    wept so that his powerful chest shook. So Gregor did not go into the room, but
    leant against the inside of the other door which was still held bolted in place.
    In this way only half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it
    which he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the
    day had become much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the other
    side of the street \u2013 which was a hospital \u2013 could be seen quite clearly
    with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its fa\xE7ade; the rain
    was still falling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the
    ground one at a time. The washing up from breakfast lay on the table; there was
    so much of it because, for Gregor\u2019s father, breakfast was the most important
    meal of the day and he would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading
    a number of different newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph
    of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand and a carefree
    smile on his face as he called forth respect for his uniform and bearing. The
    door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was also
    open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down
    below. \u201CNow, then\u201D, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one
    to have kept calm, \u201CI\u2019ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples
    and set off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see\u201D, he said to
    the chief clerk, \u201Cthat I\u2019m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being
    a commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn\u2019t earn
    my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything
    accurately, then? It\u2019s quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable
    to work, but that\u2019s just the right time to remember what\u2019s been achieved
    in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty has been removed,
    he will certainly work with all the more diligence and concentration. You\u2019re
    well aware that I\u2019m seriously in debt to our employer as well as having to
    look after my parents and my sister, so that I\u2019m trapped in a difficult situation,
    but I will work my way out of it again. Please don\u2019t make things any harder
    for me than they are already, and don\u2019t take sides against me at the office.
    I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn an enormous wage as
    well as having a soft time of it. That\u2019s just prejudice but they have no
    particular reason to think better of it. But you, sir, you have a better overview
    than the rest of the staff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better
    overview than the boss himself \u2013 it\u2019s very easy for a businessman like
    him to make mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than he should.
    And you\u2019re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year
    away from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip and chance
    and groundless complaints, and it\u2019s almost impossible to defend yourself
    from that sort of thing, we don\u2019t usually even hear about them, or if at
    all it\u2019s when we arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that\u2019s
    when we feel the harmful effects of what\u2019s been going on without even knowing
    what caused them. Please, don\u2019t go away, at least first say something to
    show that you grant that I\u2019m at least partly right!\u201D But the chief clerk
    had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to speak, and, with protruding lips,
    only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep
    still for a moment while Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door
    without taking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been
    some secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had reached the
    entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot from the living room,
    and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out
    towards the stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force waiting
    to save him. Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief
    clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into
    extreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very well; over
    the years, they had become convinced that this job would provide for Gregor for
    his entire life, and besides, they had so much to worry about at present that
    they had lost sight of any thought for the future. Gregor, though, did think about
    the future. The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally
    won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister
    were here! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still lying
    peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could
    persuade him; she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him
    out of his shocked state. But his sister was not there, Gregor would have to do
    the job himself. And without considering that he still was not familiar with how
    well he could move about in his present state, or that his speech still might
    not \u2013 or probably would not \u2013 be understood, he let go of the door;
    pushed himself through the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing
    who, ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but Gregor
    fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought something to hold
    onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had that happened than, for the
    first time that day, he began to feel alright with his body; the little legs had
    the solid ground under them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them;
    they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was
    soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held back
    the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there on the floor.
    His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed
    in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her
    fingers spread shouting: \u201CHelp, for pity\u2019s sake, Help!\u201D The way
    she held her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the unthinking
    way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not; she had forgotten that
    the table was behind her with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached
    the table she sat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without
    even seeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of
    coffee was pouring down onto the carpet. \u201CMother, mother\u201D, said Gregor
    gently, looking up at her. He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the
    moment, but could not help himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight
    of the flow of coffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table
    and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though, had
    no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already reached the
    stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for the last time. Gregor
    made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must
    have expected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and disappeared;
    his shouts resounding all around the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk
    seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor\u2019s father into a panic as well. Until
    then he had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running after
    the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,
    Gregor\u2019s father seized the chief clerk\u2019s stick in his right hand (the
    chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat and overcoat), picked
    up a large newspaper from the table with his left, and used them to drive Gregor
    back into his room, stamping his foot at him as he went. Gregor\u2019s appeals
    to his father were of no help, his appeals were simply not understood, however
    much he humbly turned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.
    Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor\u2019s mother had pulled open
    a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A strong draught
    of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the curtains flew up, the
    newspapers on the table fluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.
    Nothing would stop Gregor\u2019s father as he drove him back, making hissing noises
    at him like a wild man. Gregor had never had any practice in moving backwards
    and was only able to go very slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round
    he would have been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he
    took the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there was the
    threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father\u2019s
    hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as
    he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of going backwards in a straight
    line; so he began, as quickly as possible and with frequent anxious glances at
    his father, to turn himself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father
    was able to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now
    and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a distance as to
    which way to turn. If only his father would stop that unbearable hissing! It was
    making Gregor quite confused. When he had nearly finished turning round, still
    listening to that hissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little
    the way he had just come. He was pleased when he finally had his head in front
    of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad
    to get through it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it obviously
    did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that Gregor
    would have enough space to get through. He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor
    should be got back into his room as quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have
    allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation for getting through
    the doorway. What he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards
    all the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as
    if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant experience,
    and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without regard for what might happen.
    One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank
    scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks
    on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself,
    the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other
    side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him a hefty
    shove from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying,
    and heavily bleeding, deep into his room. The door was slammed shut with the stick,
    then, finally, all was quiet.\r\n"
